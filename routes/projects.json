        "description":"A deep GAN neural network trained to generate concrete mixes for desirable tensile and compressive strengths of resulting concrete. Concrete research and design can be a time-consuming and expensive process that consists of reptitive testings. ConcreteNN is aimed to provide a more sustainable and efficient solution to concrete mix design by generating a preliminary mix before the actual testing stage. Started as a collabroation project between ETS and the University of Waterloo Concrete Canoe Team, ConcreteNN is currently being used to generate preliminary mix designs by the University of Waterloo Concrete Toboggan and Concrete Canoe design team.",

        "description":"At first, I created this app to help myself learn a list of Japanese words I jotted down in a random txt file. It was initially just a small PyQt app I wrote on a whim, but now it is a full-fleged object oriented Android app with lots of customizability and a handful of shuffling algorithms. Flahshmemorize can turn any .txt file into a deck of flashcards completed with pictures. Its versatility is what put it a cut above its competetors such as Anki, especially for students like myself who constantly switch between devices between home, school, and work. The original Qt Application is currently discontinued as I am trying to focus on the Android app right now.",
